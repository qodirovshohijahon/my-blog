Used technologies

1. **[React](https://ru.reactjs.org/)** (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. 
React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However,
React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing. 
* **Declarative:** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render   just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
* **Component-Based:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript  instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.
* **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:** We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
2. **[Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/ru/)** 
  React components for faster and simpler web development. Build your own design system, or start with Material Design.
